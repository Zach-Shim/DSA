## **Real-Life Examples of Lists**

Consider lists you might encounter in real life:
- a list of chores,
- a list of important dates,
- a list of addresses,
- a grocery list
- ...

Take an example of a grocery list.
When you write a grocery list, where do you put new items?
- You could add new items to the end (bottom) of the list
- You could add new items to the beginning of the list
- You could write down items in alphabetical order
- You could write them randomly for all you care! (but this wouldn’t be very coherent or easy to understand)

## **Sequence Containers**

Regardless of the order, the items on a list appear in some sort of an organized **sequence**.

For a **sequence container**, 
	the **position** (index) of an element 
	depends on 
	the **order** **(time and place)** of insertion.

An element’s **position** is ***independent*** of its **value**.
This means that elements are inserted into a container based on **time** (i.e., item1 was inserted before item2) and **place** (i.e., front or end of container).

The six items in the Figure 8-1 list have some sort of **sequential order**
The kind of sequence they are organized by, is dependent on how you want to order the items.
- Are items inserted at the front of the list?
- Are items inserted at the back of the list?
- etc…
## **Lists Items**

A list has
1. A single first item
2. A single last item
3. Items in between the first and last items

The first item—the **head** or **front** of the list—does not have a predecessor
The last item—the **tail** or end of the list—does not have a successor
Each item in the middle of the list (between the first and last items) has a unique **predecessor** and a unique **successor**.
## **List Operations**

Lists contain items that are all of the **same type**.
We can perform a number of actions on the items in the list.
1. You could **count** the items on the list,
2. You could **add** a new item to the list,
3. You could **remove** an existing item from the list,
4. You could **get** (retrieve/find) an item in the list,
5. etc.

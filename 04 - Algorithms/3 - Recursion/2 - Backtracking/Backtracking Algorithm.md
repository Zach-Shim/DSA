The following is a generic backtracking algorithm:
```
function backtrack(candidate):
    if candidate is a valid solution:
        add candidate to the list of solutions
        return
    
    for each possible choice:
        if choice is feasible:
            make choice
            backtrack(next candidate)
            undo choice (backtrack)

function solveProblem():
    initialize an empty list of solutions
    initialize an empty candidate solution
    backtrack(candidate)
    return list of solutions
```

This template outlines the general structure of a backtracking algorithm. You can adapt and customize it based on the specific problem you're solving. Here's a brief explanation of each part:

1. `backtrack(candidate)`: This is the main backtracking function. It takes a candidate solution as input and recursively explores all possible choices to construct valid solutions. If a valid solution is found, it adds it to the list of solutions. If not, it backtracks and tries a different choice.
    
2. `if candidate is a valid solution`: This condition checks whether the current candidate solution satisfies the problem's constraints and represents a valid solution. If it does, the candidate is added to the list of solutions.
    
3. `for each possible choice`: This loop iterates over all possible choices for the next step in constructing the candidate solution. It's often implemented using a loop or recursion.
    
4. `if choice is feasible`: This condition checks whether the current choice is feasible and doesn't violate any constraints. If it is, the choice is made, and the algorithm proceeds to explore further. If not, the algorithm skips this choice.
    
5. `make choice`: This step updates the candidate solution by making the current choice. It modifies the state of the solution to reflect the choice.
    
6. `backtrack(next candidate)`: This step recursively explores the next step in constructing the candidate solution. It calls the `backtrack` function with the updated candidate.
    
7. `undo choice (backtrack)`: This step undoes the choice made in the current step. It resets the state of the candidate solution to its previous state before the choice was made. This is crucial for backtracking to try alternative choices.
    
8. `solveProblem()`: This function initializes the list of solutions, initializes an empty candidate solution, and starts the backtracking process. It returns the list of solutions once the backtracking is complete.
    

You can customize this template by implementing specific logic for your problem within the `backtrack` function, including defining the valid solution condition, determining feasible choices, and making and undoing choices.

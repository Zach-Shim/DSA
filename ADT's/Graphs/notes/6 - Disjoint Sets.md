The **Union-Find Disjoint Sets (UFDS) ADT** is used to model a collection of disjoint sets. **Disjoint sets** are sets that have no elements in common.

The Disjoint Sets ADT can be used to find connected components in an undirected graph. Therefore, it can be used with Kruskal's algorithm for the [Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)](https://visualgo.net/en/mst) problem.

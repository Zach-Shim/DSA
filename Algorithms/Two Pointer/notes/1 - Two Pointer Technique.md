## **Overview**
The two-pointer technique uses two pointers to solve a problem.

## **How To Use It?**

**1.**     **Identify if the problem requires the two-pointer technique**

**What Data Structures Should We Use It On?**

Contiguous sequences of elements are any collections that can be linearly iterated over:

·      Strings

·      Arrays

·      Linked lists

·      Etc.

**Common Questions to Identify**

1.     Does the problem request a search of two or more items?

If this is not directly what the question is asking for, can it be reduced to such a task?

2.     Should the array be sorted before pointers are initialized?

3.     Should pointers be moving at different speeds?

4.     Should pointers be updated one at a time or simultaneously?

**2.**     **Identify where to put the pointers**

Should one pointer start at the beginning and one at the end of the collection?

**3.**     **Identify how to move the pointers**

Should the pointers move at the same speed?

Should one pointer move fast, and the other slow?

**4.**     **Identify the terminating condition**

Should we terminate the two-pointer algorithm when the two pointers cross?
